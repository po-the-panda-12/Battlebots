1,"We’re not too concerned about Blacksmith’s weapon, it’s not that powerful. It’s really cool looking. But we’re very worried about the reliability so they’re hard to knock out. So, I might have to try to get them towards the wall and try to hit them out of the arena, see if we can damage something inside."
0,"Our strategy is going to be to try to keep the spinner away from the front of our hammer assembly that is slightly exposed. We’re going with our heavy forks; we’re going to try to keep them away from our front. We want to come out of the gate with a win. We want to do well in the rankings, and we don’t want to start in the hole with a negative, with a loss so that’s very important to make a good impression."
0,"We're taking weight off the other parts of the robot to make attachments to defeat him. So, you gotta think out of the box sometimes. You have to win your first battle. If you lose, then you're, like-- It's-it's devastating."
1,"The pressure is huge. It's a new robot. I haven't tested it a ton, and anything could happen so the pressure is max right now. If we can keep working, keep it together, I think we’ll win the fight."
1,"The fight between me and Bombshell is just going to be a flat-out driving war. He's a fast driver. He's experienced. He's the number-two seed from Last season, you know?  I'm not really sure how it's going to go, but I know it's going to be a great match."
0,"This is going to have to be a very high-aggression fight. We’re both very nimble bots so whoever loses control of the fight for five seconds, could Lose the entire fight in that moment."
0,My strategy against Icewave is constant aggression. I need to be on them from the start of the fight and not let them get up to speed cause that’s when they're the most stable that they can be. Do not Let them spin up and hopefully tip them over.
1,"The biggest problem against Vanquish is that he's got a big plow on the front that's really thick steal. So if we glance off of it, it's gonna be a problem. We're gonna flip over. We gotta go around the back and hit ‘em from there. Icewave is not invertible, so we have to be extremely careful not to get ourselves flipped. We installed a shorter blade because  that one is better balanced, and it will keep us more stable for this fight."
1,"Our robot is the type of robot that always has to the first hit before it can be aggressive. So, I have to be defensive first before I can be offensive. And with robots like that, with those heavy spinners it's always a risk. "
0,"I've heard rumors that they, I think, apply about 10 metric tons of crushing force. No armor we have is really gonna withstand that, so we're gonna go with our offensive mode and try to disable them early."
1,"So, the first battle's pivotal, it sets the mood. Ultimately, what would be great, is if we could just go in there with Brutus cut it open, tear some batteries out and light the thing on fire. Then everyone is scared right. They're all running. And you get in their heads a little bit. You get in their mind space, and you can freak them out a little bit. "
0,"For my fight against Red Devil, I’ve added an extra Layer of top armor of full titanium skin on top, which I'll doubt they’ll get through. Their robot, I think, is pretty stout from the front. But really vulnerable on three other sides. Those tread pods, while providing a Lot of traction, are rather delicate. So, I think I can easily hit one and take the robot out."
1,"Yeah, we wanna send the message that we're out there to kill and to kill fast. Hopefully, people will be scared of us after this first one. Our strategy for this match is to just kinda rush them to the side of the game before they can get up to speed. We know we can spin up a lot faster than they can. So hopefully we can hit them and get them upside down as soon as this game starts."
0,"You've met my dad, right?  His whole persona is mind games and intimidation. So, it's gonna be the same thing with me, you know. I think they're relatively new, not trying to detract from them, but I think we have a little bit more experience when it comes to fighting robots. So, not too much to worry about."
0,"I think even though we’re usually very aggressive, we’re gonna try to hang back a little bit and see what he does first. We’re gonna let him be the aggressor and kinda dance around a little bit and place our shot a little bit better."
1,"You know, the nice thing is I am never going to have any strategy other than full forward, full offense, and everyone here knows it. They know it’s gonna be coming. Coming out of the gate, this first fight is important. I feel like I really need to win this one and prove that last time wasn’t a fluke. That Yeti is legit, it’s here to stay. "
1,"My strategy against Overhaul is to take it to him straight. We have a decided advantage that we have long implements. So we’re easily able to outreach him, and we’ll get the advantage very quickly. We’re not gonna let it go to the judges. I’m gonna call my KO right here, right now."
0,"Those three wedges that he has are super low. I’ve sharpened Overhaul’s arms and forks to try to get under him, so I have to just stay on top of my game, maybe calm down a little bit, not be as impressive as I usually am. I think Overhaul has a great shot at winning this match if I drive strategically and I keep SawBlaze under control."
1,"I feel pretty good about the matchup. He’s got a lot of speed, out robot is tough. Our strategy for this fight is to bot-rush him and roll him around the arena. We’re gonna try to take the fight to him.   "
0,"Oh, this is gonna be a judo fight. I mean we’re both dynamic robots, we’re both invertible. I’m gonna be going my best to get around to his side or his back and he’s gonna be doing his best to do the same to me, so its gonna be a dance."
0,"I’d like to be all up in his face right after the first second is over, before the lights even are at full brightness. Our drum spins up very quickly. It does weigh 110 pounds, so there’s a lot of inertia. You know, like I said, anything goes one the box is locked and three two one, go."
1,"His Achilles’ hell is gonna be the big wheels. WarHawk has a 40 pound AR steel spinning disc in the front and it should go around 4,000 RPM and that should be able to knock his wheels off and put a pretty big dent in it."
0,"I know we can out—drive them. I think we have a more powerful weapon. And I think that combination will give us the win. I'm eager to get in there and see what this can do, and, you know, this is a hell of a machine, and I'm just excited to see it work."
1,"We're pretty worried about HyperShock because their weapon is very powerful. They also have Lifting forks that are pretty sharp and low to the ground. The strategy against HyperShock, the same as everyone else, is sort of keep the front end of the robot aimed at them. We have our offense and defense all at the front of the robot. It is really tough to drive against them, because their robot's very fast. If we ever get hit by their weapon, it's very powerful, it could do a lot of damage."
0,"Today, we're running Red Devil with a plow configuration with a heavily armored front end. The strategy is to, realistically, out-drive ‘em and try to get to the left or the right of their weapon, where we can get the saw down into their innards and let it do some damage."
1,"The strategy has got to be; avoid contact until we can serve up the weapon and then just go in for a great big hit really, yeah. We want to get this down within two minutes, really, before the kill saws come up, right? We're hoping it can do the job."
